# E-Commerce Website Product Analysis

## Project Description

This project involves analyzing an Amazon sales dataset to uncover valuable insights about customer sentiment, product performance, and pricing trends. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis on product reviews, and creating visualizations, we gain a better understanding of the product landscape in the e-commerce space.

### Key Insights and Findings:
- Sentiment distribution of product reviews: Positive, Negative, Neutral sentiments.
- Top products with the highest ratings and discount percentages.
- Correlation between product prices and customer ratings.
- Insights into customer reviews and common trends.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating plots and visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced visualizations (like count plots, histograms, etc.).
- **TextBlob**: For performing sentiment analysis on review content.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive analysis environment.

## Steps Followed:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the dataset and examined the structure.
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values and formatting issues.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Investigated the relationship between various features such as price, rating, and product category.

   - Applied **TextBlob** to classify sentiment in product reviews (positive, negative, or neutral).
   - Visualized the sentiment distribution to understand customer opinions.

4. **Product Insights**:
